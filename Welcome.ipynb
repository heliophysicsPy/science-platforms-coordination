There is an [**Extended** environment](https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/v2/gh/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/heliocloud-base-w-survey-extended?urlpath=lab/tree/Welcome.ipynb) that builds on this with more packages.\n",

    "## ðŸ“Š How We Built This Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment was created based on a comprehensive [survey](https://forms.gle/MqJw4f6hQ6ix8e6e6) of heliophysicists about their software usage. We analyzed `pip freeze` outputs from researchers across four identified categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing and Analysis Tools**\n",
    "2. **Data Fusion and Visualization**\n",
    "3. **Modeling and Simulations**\n",
    "4. **Software Development and Data Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Selection Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a restrictive threshold that filtered out packages that appeared in less than half the responses, we identified strong patterns of package usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/S4fgmFz8/restrictive-thresholds.png\" alt=\"Restrictive thresholds venn diagram\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Core Environment** includes:\n",
    "- **32 common packages** used across all categories (numpy, matplotlib, astropy, etc.)\n",
    "- **85 packages** from the large intersection between Data Fusion/Visualization and Software Development\n",
    "- **9 essential packages** promoted from outside that intersection (sunpy, pytest, jupyter, cdflib, netCDF4, Pillow, scikit-image, zarr, numba)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total: 127 packages** covering many typical heliophysics Python workflows\n",

    "## ðŸŽ¯ Why Two Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "We created two environments to balance usability with comprehensiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core (this environment)**: For everyday interactive analysis, visualization, and development. Lighter, faster to load, includes the most commonly used tools.\n",
    "- [**Extended**](https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/v2/gh/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/heliocloud-base-w-survey-extended?urlpath=lab/tree/Welcome.ipynb): Adds specialized packages for production workflows, documentation generation, and domain-specific data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heavy overlap between Data Fusion/Visualization and Software Development users (85 shared packages!) showed us that most heliophysicists work at this intersectionâ€”analyzing data interactively while developing tools. This Core environment serves that sweet spot.\n",
