    "This HelioCloud JupyterLab instance is [maintained](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/tree/main) by the **Science Platforms Coordination IHDEA Working Group**. It is the base image that all our other environments build upon. It provides **zero-install access** to a minimal set of Python packages commonly used in heliophysics research, but as the minimal base image, you should expect to pip/conda install many packages you'll want to use yourself (e.g. at the tops of notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this base image if you want the fastest load times, and/or if you encounter dependency conflicts trying to add packages to another one of our environments. The other environments may already pre-install the packages you want to use. \n",
