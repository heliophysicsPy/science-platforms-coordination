    "\n",
    "This environment was created based on a comprehensive [survey](https://forms.gle/MqJw4f6hQ6ix8e6e6) of heliophysicists about their software usage. We analyzed `pip freeze` outputs from researchers across four identified categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing and Analysis Tools**\n",
    "2. **Data Fusion and Visualization**\n",
    "3. **Modeling and Simulations**\n",
    "4. **Software Development and Data Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Selection Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a restrictive threshold that filtered out packages that appeared in less than half the responses, we identified strong patterns of package usage:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/S4fgmFz8/restrictive-thresholds.png\" alt=\"Restrictive thresholds venn diagram\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Extended Environment** includes:\n",
    "- All **127 packages** from the Core environment\n",
    "- **29 additional packages** from Software Development âˆ© Data Processing (down from 35 because 6 were moved to Core)\n",
    "- **34 additional packages** from Data Fusion âˆ© Data Processing (down from 38 because 4 were moved to Core)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total: 190 packages** providing comprehensive coverage of heliophysics Python workflows\n",

Lighter, faster to load, includes the most commonly used tools.\n",
    "- **Extended (this environment)**: Adds specialized packages for production workflows, documentation generation, and domain-specific data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heavy overlap between Data Fusion/Visualization and Software Development users (85 shared packages!) showed us that most heliophysicists work at that intersectionâ€”analyzing data interactively while developing tools. This Extended environment builds on that to include the less common packages from survey results.\n",
