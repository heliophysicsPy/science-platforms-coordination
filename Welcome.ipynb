    "This HelioCloud JupyterLab instance is maintained by the **Science Platforms Coordination IHDEA Working Group**. It is the base image that all our other environments build upon. It provides **zero-install access** to a minimal set of Python packages commonly used in heliophysics research, but as the minimal base image, you should expect to pip/conda install many packages you'll want to use yourself (e.g. at the tops of notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
