    "1. **Data Processing and Analysis Tools**\n",

    "3. **Modeling and Simulations**\n",
    "4. **Software Development and Data Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Selection Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a restrictive threshold that filtered out packages that appeared in less than half the responses, we identified strong patterns of package usage:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/S4fgmFz8/restrictive-thresholds.png\" alt=\"Restrictive thresholds venn diagram\"/>\n",

    "- All **127 packages** from the Core environment\n",
    "- **29 additional packages** from Software Development ‚à© Data Processing (down from 35 because 6 were moved to Core)\n",
    "- **34 additional packages** from Data Fusion ‚à© Data Processing (down from 38 because 4 were moved to Core)\n",

    "- **Extended (this environment)**: Adds specialized packages for production workflows, documentation generation, and domain-specific data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heavy overlap between Data Fusion/Visualization and Software Development users (85 shared packages!) showed us that most heliophysicists work at that intersection‚Äîanalyzing data interactively while developing tools.
