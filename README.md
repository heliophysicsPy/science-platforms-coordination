# Science Platforms Coordination IHDEA Working Group Environments

Our goal is to develop international standard software computing environments for Heliophysics.

This repo houses the source files for the four environments we have created so far. They are in the following branches:
1. [HelioCloud Base Image](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/tree/heliocloud-base-2025-update)
2. [PyHC Environment](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/tree/pyhc)
3. [Heliophysics "Core" Survey Environment](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/tree/heliocloud-base-w-survey-core)
4. [Heliophysics "Extended" Survey Environment](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/science-platforms-coordination/tree/heliocloud-base-w-survey-extended)
